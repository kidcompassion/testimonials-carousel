** Custom Post Type Plugin **

This plugin, when installed, will programmatically create a custom post type. This one is made for testimonials, but you can change it to be called whatever you like by swapping out "testimonials" for your desired name.

When using this with Elementor, you'll want to got to the Elementor settings page and make sure you add the Elementor editor to your new custom post type.
